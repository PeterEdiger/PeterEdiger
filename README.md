## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Peter. Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a typical bootcamper who came into coding through my cousin and YouTube. I donâ€™t have a story where I started coding at 7 years old. I began at 39, working hard to improve every day and build new projects. Check out my work, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DABubble a Slack clone. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular and Typescript.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding and projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: info@peter-ediger.de
